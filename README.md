- 👋 Hi, I’m @drlongnecker!  _Got started developing on AIX mainframes in C and haven't looked back since!_
- 👀 I’m interested in developing portable apps, devops, optimizing systems and augmenting people.
- ☀️ I spend my days leading product development in the fintech sector, focused on experimentation, analytics, AI, and bringing great tech to customers no matter their platform.
- 🌙 I spend my evenings focused on productivity 📃 and game 🎮 development, the hip cool craze around generative AI 🤖 and LLMs, and building various tech using whatever I can get my hands on.
- 📒 blog  @ [https://drlongnecker.com](https://drlongnecker.com/) with ramblings about everything and nothing.
