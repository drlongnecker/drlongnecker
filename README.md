- 👋 Hi, I’m @drlongnecker!  _Got started developing on AIX mainframes in C and haven't looked back since!_
- 👀 I’m interested in developing portable apps, devops, and optimizing people and system processes.
- 🔎 I'm currently focused on C++ game 🎮 development, the hip cool craze around generative AI 🤖 and LLMs, and building various tech around the dotnet 🌐 stack.
- 📒 blog  @ [https://drlongnecker.com](https://drlongnecker.com/) with ramblings about everything and nothing.
